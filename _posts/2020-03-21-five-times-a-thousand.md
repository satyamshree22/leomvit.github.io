excerpt: "Five times one thousand is the number of steps that I’ve taken on this long road,"
---
Five times one thousand is the number of steps that I’ve taken on this long road,

It is the number of thoughts that have passed though my head,

The number of breaths that I have taken.

Five times one thousand is the number of beats in this path,

It is the number of trails laid before me,

The number of forks in the road.

And although I am lost, on this track unknown, 

In this forest so old,

Filled with all of my doubt, suspicion, fear and solitude,

I know I will find my way through.

For five times one thousand steps have been taken here already,

Five times one thousand people have been here before,

On the same path that I am now following on the floor,

But those five times one thousand hearts will never beat quite like mine.

And my five times one thousand steps will get me closer to the finish line,

My thoughts are going to become clearer,

My breath is going to race faster.

But all of this will come in time,

For now I am here alone,

This beaten path will eventually take me home.
